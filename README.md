# Dominant Set Clustering algorithm

Clustering camera poses generated by a SFM pipeline such as openMVG. The library gives a list of view clusters.

The library is sfm appliction agnostic. It requires view poses and sparse point positions.
It uses affinity propogation to cluster poses.

This libary is an implementation of "Dominant set clustering" introduced by Maura, Massimo et al. at ETHZ Zurich Computer Vision Lab
